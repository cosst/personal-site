              Hi friend,
            </p>
            <p>
              While I have been a techie ever since I took apart our family computer and put it back together again in middle school, my path to working as a developer is a bit more recent.
            </p>
            <p>
              The first site I ever built was for my <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20080930201121/http://hamdenhighbaseball.com:80/" target="_blank">high school's baseball team</a> (please excuse the dead image links) back in 2005. After attending college in sunny SoCal, living in Hawaii for a year, working at a high-end recruiting startup on the east coast, and co-founding and growing <a href="http://sidebench.com/" target="_blank">Sidebench</a> (a tech product consultancy) for five years (<a href="https://www.inc.com/profile/sidebench" target="_blank">#329 on the Inc. 500 list for 2017</a>), I reached a mutual decision with my friend & business partner to leave Sidebench and finally returned to the wonderful world of code in July of 2017. 
            </p>
            <p>
              Since then I have been studying, learning, and most importantly building things (!) to grow my own full-stack development skillset. Thus far I have focused primarily on JavaScript, and more specifically React & Node, though I am interested in expanding out from there as well. I am also working my way through Harvard's CS50 course, and I plan to continue with other online CS courses to build a solid foundation there.
            </p>
            <p>
              Technologies that I am currently comfortable with include JavaScript, React, Vue, Node, Python, Express, MongoDB, RethinkDB, REST APIs, Mocha, Chai, webpack, Babel, Git, Yarn/npm, Heroku, and Firebase.
            </p>
            <p>
              While not everything I have done thus far can be shared publicly, a few projects of mine are listed below. You are welcome to view <a href="https://github.com/cosst" target="_blank">my full GitHub profile</a> as well.

            </div>
            <p>
              I have started working on a contract basis and am open to consulting or development opportunities as well as full-time development or internship positions. If you are interested in discussing how I can help, <a href="/#/contact">please shoot me a message</a>.
